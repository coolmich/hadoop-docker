Hadoop MapReduce Counter provides a way to measure the progress or the number of operations that occur within MapReduce programs Basically MapReduce framework provides a number of built-in counters to measure basic I/O operations such as FILE_BYTES_READ/WRITTEN and Map/Combine/Reduce input/output records These counters are very useful especially when you evaluate some MapReduce programs Besides the MapReduce Counter allows users to employ your own counters Since MapReduce Counters are automatically aggregated over Map and Reduce phases it is one of the easiest way to investigate internal behaviors of MapReduce programs In this post Iâ€™m going to introduce how to use your own MapReduce Counter The example sources described in this post are based on Hadoop 0.21 API
